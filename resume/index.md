## About Me


My name is Rich Siegel

## What is your current role?

Iâ€™m currently a Systems Architect

## Why does this resume look so different?

This resume has been written in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and uses [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) to generate the content.  I love to use Git so I decided to put the entirety of my resume onto [Github](http://www.github.com).
